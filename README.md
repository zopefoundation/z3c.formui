# z3c.formui

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zopefoundation/z3c.formui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zopefoundation/z3c.formui)

This package provides a set of default layouts for the ``z3c.form``
framework. In particular it provides a DIV-based and a TABLE-based layout. The
developer can use either layout by inheriting from a different base layer.

The package also has some support for layout/pagelet templates.

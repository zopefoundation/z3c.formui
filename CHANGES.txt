2.2.1 (2012-01-09)
------------------

- No longer using deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest`` but built-in
  ``doctest`` instead.
- Fixed tests so they do not break for `z3c.form` 2.5.0.


2.2.0 (2009-12-28)
------------------

- Fixed tests so they do not break for `z3c.form` 2.2.0.

- Using ``requiredInfo`` property (introduced in `z3c.form` 2.0.0) to
  render the information about required fields. This property returns
  an i18n message id making the information translateable.

- Added support for groups containing groups: They get displayed now.

2.1.0 (2009-09-01)
------------------

- Feature: Don't show required info hint if there's no required fields.

- Bug: Don't render add forms when redirecting as well.

- Bug: Fix redirection tests with newer zope.publisher that restricts
  untrusted redirects to different domains.

2.0.0 (2009-06-14)
------------------

- Feature: Added support for context-specific template lookup, introduced in
  `z3c.template` 1.2.0 - templates can now be registered using (view, request,
  context) discriminator.

- Feature: Added support for `z3c.pt` templates using `z3c.ptcompat`
  compatibility package.

- Feature: Added layout support for `IAdding` component based add forms.

- Feature: Added CSS for multi-widget which was added in `z3c.form` 2.0.0.

- Bug: Changed usage of ``template/macros/*`` to ``macro:*``, because the
  first one doesn't work when we override a form template and use the form
  macro, registered with this package.

- Bug: Don't do rendering in form's `__call__` method when request is a
  redirection.

- Bug: Reformatted long-description to render properly on pypi.


1.4.2 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Bug: Corrected typos and unwanted unicode characters.


1.4.1 (2008-01-23)
------------------

- Bug: Fixed up meta-data and the release.


1.4.0 (2008-01-21)
------------------

- Feature: Added subform content and layout template. This allows you to
  configure real sub forms which do not render the form tag.

- Feature: Improve layout implementation, support built-in layout templates.

- Feature: Use ``IContentTemplate`` instead of ``IPageTemplate`` in layout
  base classes. This will help to prevent running into recursion errors if
  there is a missing layout template.

- Feature: Added form module which offers built-in layout support.

- Bug: Added missing display ``IContentTemplate``, otherwise we can run into a
  recursion in some cases.

- Bug: Renamed table macro argument from ``form-required-info`` to
  ``required-info``. The macro ``form-required-info`` did not exist.

- Bug: Added unit tests for layout support.

- Bug: Added tests for layout macros.

- Bug: Added tests for layout templates.


1.3.0 (2007-08-24)
------------------

- Refactoring: Update CSS classes to reflect latest changes to the widget
  classes in ``z3c.form``.

- Bug: Error view snippets may have a empty ``widget`` attribute values, so we
  cannot rely on accessing the label of the widget. This is the case, if the
  error view sniipet was created from an invariants validation error.

- Bug: The table-form template did not properly render the error at the
  widget, because the ``render()`` method was not called. Thanks to Markus
  Leist for the report.


1.2.0 (2007-07-18)
------------------

- Feature: The row div element now also has an id of the form
  "<widget-id>-row".


1.1.1 (2007-07-04)
------------------

- Refactoring: Split up registrations for simpler management of UI
  components. This also makes it easier to see for developers how to create a
  new template for forms.


1.1.0 (2007-06-29)
------------------

- Feature: Registered all defined macros for each form template. Also, added
  more slots to the templates providing more hooks for customization.

- Feature: Added a macro/slot for the "required info", which explains how
  required fields are marked.

- Feature: Added support for form labels.

- Feature: Added support for groups to templates.


1.0.1 (2007-06-22)
------------------

- Bug: Make sure we use the id for the "for" attribute of the "label"
  element and not the name. This has worked until recently, because the
  name and id were the same, but they are different now.


1.0.0 (2007-05-24)
------------------

- Initial Release
